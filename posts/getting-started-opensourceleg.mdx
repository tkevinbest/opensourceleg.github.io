The Open-Source Leg platform is designed to make prosthetics research more accessible and reproducible. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to get started with the platform.

## What is the Open-Source Leg?

The Open-Source Leg is an end-to-end open-source platform that includes:

- **Hardware designs** - Complete CAD files and manufacturing instructions
- **Software libraries** - Python-based control systems and interfaces
- **Documentation** - Comprehensive guides and API references
- **Community support** - Active forums and contributor network

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, you'll need:

### Hardware Requirements

- Access to a 3D printer or machining capabilities
- Basic electronics knowledge
- Microcontroller (Arduino or Raspberry Pi compatible)
- Various sensors and actuators (see BOM)

### Software Requirements

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Git for version control
- Basic familiarity with robotics concepts

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neurobionics/opensourceleg.git
cd opensourceleg
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Up Your Development Environment

We recommend using a virtual environment to avoid conflicts:

```bash
python -m venv opensourceleg-env
source opensourceleg-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: opensourceleg-env\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Basic Usage

### Hardware Assembly

1. **Download CAD Files**: Access the complete hardware designs on [Onshape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/3520551dd01cf402179e8687/w/87da2fb0a553b44a27833624/e/d9c95c04904f8d6a753006a4)

2. **Review the BOM**: Check the bill of materials for all required components

3. **3D Print Components**: Print the mechanical parts using the provided STL files

4. **Assemble the Hardware**: Follow the assembly guide in the documentation

### Software Setup

Once your hardware is assembled, you can start with basic software control:

```python
from opensourceleg.actuator import DephyActuator
from opensourceleg.sensors import Loadcell

# Initialize the actuator
actuator = DephyActuator(
    port="/dev/ttyACM0",
    gear_ratio=50.0,
    frequency=500
)

# Initialize sensors
loadcell = Loadcell(gain=1000, offset=0)

# Basic control loop
try:
    while True:
        # Read sensor data
        force = loadcell.read()
        
        # Simple proportional control
        torque = force * 0.1
        
        # Send command to actuator
        actuator.set_torque(torque)
        
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    actuator.stop()
```

## Key Features

### Modular Design

The platform is designed to be modular, allowing researchers to:

- Swap different sensors and actuators
- Modify control algorithms
- Adapt to different research requirements

### Real-time Control

Built for real-time applications with:

- High-frequency control loops (up to 1kHz)
- Low-latency sensor processing
- Deterministic timing guarantees

### Data Logging

Comprehensive data logging capabilities:

- Sensor data recording
- Control signal logging
- Performance metrics tracking

## Next Steps

Now that you have the basics set up, you can:

1. **Explore the Examples**: Check out the `/examples` directory for more complex use cases
2. **Read the Documentation**: Visit our [documentation site](https://neurobionics.github.io/opensourceleg/) for detailed API references
3. **Join the Community**: Connect with other researchers on our [forum](https://opensourceleg.discourse.group/)
4. **Contribute**: Help improve the platform by contributing code, documentation, or feedback

## Common Issues

### Connection Problems

If you're having trouble connecting to the hardware:

- Check your USB connections
- Verify the correct port is being used
- Ensure proper permissions (you may need to add your user to the `dialout` group on Linux)

### Performance Issues

For optimal performance:

- Use a real-time operating system when possible
- Minimize background processes during operation
- Consider using dedicated hardware for time-critical applications

## Conclusion

The Open-Source Leg platform provides a solid foundation for prosthetics research. With its modular design and comprehensive software support, you can focus on your research goals rather than rebuilding infrastructure from scratch.

Happy researching! 🦾
